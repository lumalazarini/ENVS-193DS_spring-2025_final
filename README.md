The published paper for the second dataset is:
- Stojanovic, D., Owens, G., Young, C.M., Alves, F. and Heinsohn, R. 2021. “Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird.” Restoration Ecology. DOI: 10.1111/rec.13319

This repository is for completing the Final exam for ENVS 193DS.

## Data and file information

The data folder includes two files:
- A file called SST_update2023.csv, which contains data used for Problem 2.
- A file called occdist.csv, which contains data used for Problem 3.

The code folder contains R scripts and all of the code used for the project. A line graph is created to using ggplot2 to compare monthly sea surface temperature from 2018-2023. Furthermore, the code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.
